			<h1>Learn Everything</h1>
			<p>Knomin represents projects and works across the mediums of live action film, animation, and music. Over the span of three years I've spent countless hours procrastinating and sometimes practicing, taking the steps to hone my craft and try to make something presentable for your eyes and ears.</p>
			<p>I'm not quite there yet.</p>
			<p>But for now, this site house's a collection of things I've made that I think are representative of where I am now.</p>
			<br>
			<h1>But who is behind Knomin?</h1>
			<p>My name is Christopher Vanbrussel. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, the son of an immigrant father from Suriname. I wanted to be a baseball player by day and an astronomer by night but I wasn't athletic enough (or rich enough) to play on a team and I would later flunk chemistry and advanced math. In 2009 my mother said "peace out" and left this world for something beyond us, and since then I've struggled with what I want to do with my life. In high school, I had anxiety issues and debated between music and 3D animation, and opted to learn music since it was more easily accessible. I've since made three albums and an EP, as well as scored my own films and have another album in development as of the time of writing.</p>

			<p>I came to BMCC and studied film and television as I always had an imaginative mind and thought "well hey I like to tell stories so let's see what happens here". I've since had a great time and have made films that range from lousy to pretty good. One even won an award.</p>
			<img src="images/zootopia.gif" width=300 height=200>
			<p>When I saw Zootopia in 2016 it was the inciting incident that encouraged me to finally pull the trigger and try my hand at animation, and I've seen been self teaching myself and hope to someday go to Paris and study at Gobelins.</p>
